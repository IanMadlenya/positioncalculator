Despite this Java app no longer being deployed anywhere, I decided to refactor it as an exercise in Object Orientation
and keep it here on GitHub as an example of how my software development skills have evolved over time.

This app was originally deployed through a Java web GUI. (https://github.com/androidfred/positionweb)
Both this app and the Java web GUI were replaced by a version written completely in Angular. (https://github.com/androidfred/angulator)

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.androidfred</groupId>
    <artifactId>positioncalculator</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.1</version>
    <type>jar</type>
</dependency>
```
